Reflect on your life balance. Visualise your progress over time and reconnect to what matters in your life. Make reflection a habit and gain new insights for your well-being.

Seamlessly sync your data across devices with a private link (using the [URI fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) = never sent to the server), QR code, or file. For more security and privacy, let the app generate a passphrase and encrypt your data using the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). Experience how smooth the modern web can be!

Designed with inspiration from the [Humane Tech](https://www.humanetech.com/) principles, this project explores the possibilities of offline-first web apps. Specifically - is it possible to give users full control over their private data, while still providing a smooth user experience? For the answer... well, you have to see it yourself! 😄

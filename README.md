Designed using the [Humane Tech](https://www.humanetech.com/) principles, this project explores the possibilities of offline-first web apps. Specifically - is it possible to give users full control over their private data, while still providing a smooth user experience? For the answer... well, you have to see it yourself! 😄

-   🔐 Optionally encrypt your data to improve your security and privacy. Let the app generate a strong passphrase - or choose your own.
-   🔗 Save your data as a private link (using the [URI fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) which is never sent to the server). Store your link somewhere safe (for example in your password manager), or save your code.
-   ✨ Easily access your data on any device by clicking your private link or by scanning your QR code.
-   🆓 Free as in freedom. This is [free software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/), and you're welcome to help make it even better!

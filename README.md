# Life Wheel

> Privacy-friendly Web App for Your Personal Wellbeing

Designed using the [Humane Tech](https://www.humanetech.com/) principles, this project explores the possibilities of offline-first web apps. Specifically - is it possible to give users full control over their private data, while still providing a smooth user experience? For the answer... well, you have to see it yourself! 😄

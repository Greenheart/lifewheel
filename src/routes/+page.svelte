IDEA: Maybe store derived key in sessionStorage to improve performance and UX. Or maybe only do this if the user selects "remember me"
IDEA: Maybe store encrypted output in a store, to allow it to be exported in various formats (link, QR, file)


    ENCRYPTED EXPORTS - should it all be encrypted by default to simplify development?

    IDEA: UX flow for exporting encrypted data

    0. Export options should only be available once there's actual data to export
    1. User clicks "Export data"
    2. User enters their passphrase (or generates a new one)
    3. A loading state is visible while encrypting the user data.
    4. Once the encrypted data is ready, it's saved to a store so it can be exported in multiple formats.
    5. The user can export a link, which will add "1e" to the front of the hash. Unencrypted links instead start with "0e".
    6. The user can export a file (maybe JSON plain, or encrypted binary file (including a header in front))
    


    NOTE: It might be better to add the protocol version in the header (like "0e" or "1e") instead of including it in the binary data.
        - Perhaps "0e1p" meaning "0e" no encryption and "1p" meaning protocol version 1.
        - This would make it easier to debug protocol versions too, at a slight cost of space


    ENCRYPTED IMPORTS
        - if all data is encrypted then this will be simple for developers, but probably a worse UX
        - optional encryption is possible, but takes more effort to build.
        - IDEA: For example, we could add a special sequence in the beginning of the output data to indicate whether or not the data is encrypted.
        - For example, we could add "1e" or "0e" to the beginning of the output URI/file to show if encryption is on or not.
            - This would make it possible to parse links automatically whether or not they use encryption.
            - And this would prove the versatility of the tech, as well as giving more value to people using the app.

    IDEA: UX flow for importing possibly encrypted data via the URI
    1. User loads the app with a hash URL.
    2. If the hash starts with "0e" => the data is loaded directly into the app
    2. If the hash starts with "1e" => the user is prompted for their passphrase.
    3. The app then tries decrypting their data with the passphrase.
        4. If it succeeds => the data is loaded into the app.
        4. If it fails => prompt passphrase again until decryption succeeds.
        5. Or if the user wants to, they can press "Cancel", which clears the hash and starts the app with a fresh state.
